Only include this if you need it\\
Can be used if:\\
- You have weaknesses in your model that you have not accounted for\\
- You tested improvements to your scheme that did not give good
enough results to be included in “Prefetcher Description” section\\}

Based on the results from the tagged sequential prefetcher showing that
smaller degrees tended to do better, we tried limiting the number of
prefetches generated by a single access in the DCPT implementation.
However, our simulations showed that this did not yield any improvements.
