\section{The Scheme}

The size of the prefetcher has been a limitation in our development. Hardware
components must usually be designed within an area budget, and in order to
simulate realistic conditions, the implimentation is limited to a maximum of
8KiB memory~\cite{guidelines}.

\todo[inline]{Må redgjøre for at vi ikke overskrider denne et sted i rapporten?}

The DCPT utilizes a table of ring buffers for keeping track of the deltas, and
so organizing the memory effectively is an important aspect. In the original
implementation, only 4KiB of storage are used~\cite{dcpt}.

\subsection{Tagged Sequential}

The tagged sequential prefetcher can be configured by adjusting the
\emph{degree} and \emph{distance}. The distance is how many blocks ahead of the
currently accessed block the prefetcher will fetch, and the degree is how many
consequtive blocks at this location in memory are fetched.
\todo[inline]{Andreas: Confirm phrasing of above sentence. Edit/delete sentence/todonote.}

Our prefetcher was simulated with different combinations of degree and distance,
in the range of 0--6. The combination that got the best overall score on the
benchmark tests was with degree 5 and distance 4.

\subsubsection{Hardware requirements}

With the given implementation, a tagged sequential prefetcher simply requires
one bit per cache word in order to store the associated tag. With an L2 cache
size of 1 MB and 64 bit word size, there are 128 different words in the cache,
meaning 128 bits of storage is required for the tagged prefetcher.

\todo[inline]{Calculate \% overhead, give the reader an idea of how much 1 MB,
128 bits are in comparison with the limitations.}
