\section{Results}
The results goes here.
\\
- Show that your scheme works\\
- Compare to other schemes that do the same thing. Hopefully you are better, but you need to compare anyway\\
Trick: “Oracle Scheme”\\
- Uses “perfect” information to create an upper bound on the 
performance of a class of schemes\\
- Prefetching: Best case is that all L2 accesses are hits\\
Sensitivity analysis: \\
- Check the impact of model assumptions on your
scheme
