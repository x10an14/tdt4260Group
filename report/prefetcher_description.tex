\subsection{Tagged Sequential}

The tagged sequential prefetcher 
can be configured by adjusting the \emph{degree} and \emph{distance}. The degree
determines how many blocks should be prefetched at a time, and the distance
specifies how many blocks away from the currently accessed block the prefetches
should be done. Our prefetcher was simulated with different combinations of 
degree and distance, in the range of 0-6. The combination that got the best 
overall score on the benchmark tests was with degree 5 and distance 4.

\subsubsection{Hardware requirements}

With the given implementation, a tagged sequential prefetcher simply requires
one bit per cache word in order to store the associated tag. With an L2 cache
size of 1 MB and 64 bit word size, there are 128 different words in the cache,
meaning 128 bits of storage is required for the tagged prefetcher.
