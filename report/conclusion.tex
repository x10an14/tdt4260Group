\section{Conclusion}
With the optimal parameter configurations, the speedup of the 
DCPT prefetcher is 1.033, and the speedup of the TS prefetcher is 1.030.

The TS prefetcher only requires one bit per cache line to store
the associated tag. If the size of the prefetcher is critical, then using Tagged
Sequential prefetching might be a good alternative. However, the speedup gained
by the TS prefetcher is not as great as the speedup gained by the
DCPT prefetcher. Another important observation we made is that for different 
types of applications the speedup with DCPT is a lot more stable than with TS. 
This is because the DCPT prefetcher adapts to the application during operation, 
while the TS prefetcher's behavior is completely static.
