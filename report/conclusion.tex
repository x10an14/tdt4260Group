\section{Conclusion}

With optimal parameter configurations, the speedup of the DCPT prefetcher is
1.033, and the speedup of the TS prefetcher is 1.030.

The TS prefetcher only requires one bit per cache line to store the associated
tag. Hence, if the size of the prefetcher is critical, then using a TS
prefetching might be a good alternative. However, the speedup gained by the TS
prefetcher is not as great as the speedup gained by the DCPT prefetcher.

Another important observation is that for different types of applications the
speedup with DCPT is a lot more stable than with TS. This is because the DCPT
prefetcher adapts to the application during operation, while the TS prefetcher's
behavior is completely static.
