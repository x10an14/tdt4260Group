\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} memory wall is becoming an increasing challenge for the
computers of tomorrow. The problem occurs when the on-chip speed of computations
exceed the on-chip memory capacities, creating the situation where computing
circuitry has to lie idle waiting for instructions/data to arrive from off-chip
memory locations. 

The cache is generally considered the quickest, most expensive, and smallest memory, usually residing as closely on-chip as possible. A time-gap occurs when the on-chip circuitry needs to wait some clock-cycles for the the correct instructions/data to be fetched from the slower off-chip memory, and into the cache of the chip requiring the instructions/data for computations. \emph{Prefetching} is a method for reducing this gap.

The idea behind prefetching is to have a predictive module moving instructions/data from the off-chip memory into the much faster cache memory on-chip \emph{before} it is needed. Hence, when the on-chip processor requires new instructions/data, they are already in its cache and can be made use of within a small amount of on-chip clock cycles, instead of having to wait for the off-chip memory.

The purpose of this report is to analyze and compare a DCPT prefetcher with a TS
prefetcher using the M5 simulator, where both prefetchers utilize a maximum of
8KiB. The DCPT prefetcher is implemented according to the algorithm presented in
``Storage Efficient Hardware Prefetching using Delta Correlation Prediction
Tables'' by Grannaes, Jahre, and Natvig~\cite{dcpt}. The storage limitation
makes it important to examine how the 8KiB can be used most efficiently.

The prefetchers are implemented within three callback-functions of a provided framework: prefetch\_init, prefetch\_access and prefetch\_complete. Repectively, these are called by the M5 simulator upon intialization, cache accesses and when a prefetch is complete. The M5 simulator itself runs a series of SPEC2000 benchmarks with the prefetcher being tested. The simulation results include a overall speedup, wich is used as a performance metric.
