\subsection{M5 Simulator}

The M5 simulator is a popular simulator for computer architecture research, and
it has a rich feature set \cite{user_doc}. With the given time limitations, we only utilized a
subset of it’s complex software during our development. The interface we used is
given in interface.hh and a short documentation of the functionality can be
studied there. The simulation has been performed with the default simulator
setup \todo{antar at det er det vi kommer til å gjøre}.

The simulator runs several of the SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks, so that the prefetcher
performance can be evaluated with different applications.
The benchmarks considered in this report are ammp, applu, apsi, art110, art470,
bzip2\_graphic, bzip2\_program, bzip2\_source, galgel swim, twolf and wupwise.
The score that is referred to during this report is the average speedup on these benchmarks.
