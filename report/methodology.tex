\subsection{M5 Simulator}
The M5 simulator is a popular simulator for computer architecture research, and it has a rich feature set. With the given time limitations, we only utilized a subset of it’s complex software during our development. The interface we used is given in interface.hh and a short documentation of the functionality can be studied there. The simulation has been performed with the default simulator setup (antar at det er det vi kommer til å gjøre).

Explain your experimental setup\\
- Which simulator did you use?\\
- How have you extended the simulator?\\
- Which parameters did you use for your simulations? (aim: reproducibility)\\
- Which benchmarks did you use?\\
- Why did you chose these benchmarks?\\
=> Important: should be realistic
