\section{Methodology}

The size of the prefetcher has been a limitation in our development. Hardware
components must usually be designed within an area budget, and in order to
simulate realistic conditions, the implementation is limited to a maximum of
8KiB memory~\cite{guidelines}. The simulation is performed by the M5 simulator
available on the Kongull HPC cluster at NTNU.

\todo[inline]{This sentence should belong in where we explain our
implementation. Like the scheme...``The prefetcher utilizes the interface given
in the \emph{interface.hh} file.''}

 The benchmarks considered in this report are;
``\emph{ammp}'', ``\emph{applu}'', ``\emph{apsi}'', ``\emph{art110}'',
``\emph{art470}'', ``\emph{bzip2\_graphic}'', ``\emph{bzip2\_program}'',
``\emph{bzip2\_source}'', ``\emph{galgel}'', ``\emph{swim}'', ``\emph{twolf}'',
``\emph{wupwise}''.

\todo[inline]{Andreas/Ingebrigt: Bruker vi alle disse ovenfornevnte
benchmarkene???\\
Trenger også at noen forteller meg/eller skriver selv, hvorfor
vi bruker de benchmarkene vi ender opp med å bruke!!!}

The score reported in the \textit{Results} section are scores given to our
implemented prefetchers when running the abovementioned benchmarks.

\todo[inline]{Explain your experimental setup\\
- Which simulator did you use?\\
- How have you extended the simulator?\\
- Which parameters did you use for your simulations? (aim: reproducibility)\\
- Which benchmarks did you use?\\
- Why did you chose these benchmarks?\\
$=>$ Important: should be realistic}
