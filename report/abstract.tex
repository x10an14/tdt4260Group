\begin{abstract}

This report will discuss the implementation and optimization of a Delta
Correlating Prediction Table (DCPT) prefetcher. Mainly, the optimization is
performed by changing three different parameters; the size of the prediction
table, the size of each delta ring buffer, and the maximum size of each delta.
To properly analyze our prefetcher, a number of experiments is performed and
studied. We also wanted to compare the DCPT prefetcher to a more basic
prefetcher so that the increased performance could be better reviewed. A Tagged
Sequential prefetcher was implemented for this purpose.

An experienced reader should be able to understand exactly what you have done
from only reading the abstract. This is different from a summary. Should be
short, varies from 150 to 200 word maximum. Should include a description of the
problem, the solution and the main results.
