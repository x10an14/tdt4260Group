This report discusses the implementation and optimization of a Delta Correlating
Prediction Table (DCPT) prefetcher. We perform and study a number of experiments
to properly analyze the prefetcher. We also compare the DCPT prefetcher with a
more basic Tagged Sequential (TS) prefetcher.

This report first establishes the two test parameters for the TS prefetcher;
degree and distance. Then it establishes the three test-parameters for the DCPT
prefetcher; number of entries in the table, number of deltas per entry, and size
of bits used for each delta.

We use the M5 simulator to simulate a processor running SPEC CPU2000 benchmark programs with our implemented prefetcher with different values for
these five test-parameters, to see how the DCPT prefetcher compares to the TS
prefetcher.

The TS prefetcher preforms best with a degree of 1 and a distance of 6 delivering an average speedup of 1.030. The best DCPT prefetcher has table size 98, delta size 12 and ring buffer size 35 and gives an average speedup of 1.033. Speedups from the DCPT is fairly consistent, whereas the preformance of the TS prefetcher varies a lot more from application to application.

The final DCPT implementation took 6.4KiB of space.
