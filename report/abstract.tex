This report discusses the implementation and optimization of a Delta Correlating
Prediction Table (DCPT) prefetcher. We perform and study a number of experiments
to properly analyze the prefetcher. We also compare the DCPT prefetcher with a
more basic Tagged Sequential (TS) prefetcher.

This report first establishes the two test-parameters for the TS prefetcher;
degree and distance. Then it establishes the three test-parameters for the DCPT
prefetcher; number of entries in the table, number of deltas per entry, and size
of bits used for each delta. We use the M5 simulator to simulate a processor
running SPEC CPU2000 running benchmark programs with our implemented prefetcher with
different values for these five test-parameters, to see how the DCPT prefetcher
compares to the TS prefetcher.

\todo[inline]{Lack only describing results in abstract now.}

\todo[inline]{An experienced reader should be able to understand exactly what you
have done from only reading the abstract. This is different from a summary.
Should be short, varies from 150 to 200 word maximum. Should include a
description of the problem, the solution and the main results.}
