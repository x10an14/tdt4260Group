This report discusses the implementation and optimization of a Delta Correlating
Prediction Table (DCPT) prefetcher. The analysis and optimization is mainly
performed by changing three different parameters; the size of the prediction
table, the size of each delta ring buffer, and the size of each DCPT entry.

To properly analyze the prefetcher, a number of experiments are performed and
studied. We also compare the DCPT prefetcher with a more basic prefetcher. A
Tagged Sequential prefetcher is implemented for this purpose.

Should be short, varies from 150 to 200 word maximum. Should include a
