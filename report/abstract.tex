\begin{abstract}

This report discusses the implementation and optimization of a Delta Correlating
Prediction Table (DCPT) prefetcher. We perform and study a number of experiments
to properly analyze the prefetcher. We also compare the DCPT prefetcher with a
more basic Tagged Sequential (TS) prefetcher.

\todo[inline]{Decide whether to keep this sentence:
We analyze the performance by changing three
different parameters; the number of entries in the table of the prediction
table, the size of each delta ring buffer, and the size of each DCPT entry.}

\todo[inline]{An experienced reader should be able to understand exactly what you
have done from only reading the abstract. This is different from a summary.
Should be short, varies from 150 to 200 word maximum. Should include a
description of the problem, the solution and the main results.}
