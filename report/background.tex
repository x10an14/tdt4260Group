\section{Background}

In this section, we go over the algorithmic details of the two prefetchers we
have chosen to implement, detailing how our implemented prefetchers are intended
to work.

\subsection{Tagged Sequential Prefetching Algorithm}

The simplest prefetcher is the Sequential prefetcher, which fetches the next
block of data \cite{seq}. The Tagged Sequential prefetcher is a slight
improvement over the Sequential prefetcher. As with Sequential prefetching the
spatial locality of data is exploited.

Additionally, a tagging system is used to mark the cache blocks that have been
prefetched. This system is used to recognize when a prefetched cache block is
accessed by the application, which implies that there has been a successful
prefetch. Subsequent blocks are prefetched into the cache when there has been a
cache miss, or when a previously prefetched cache entry has been
accessed~\cite{grannaes}.

The Tagged Sequential prefetcher can be configured by adjusting two parameters;
the \emph{distance} is how many blocks ahead of the currently accessed block the
prefetcher will fetch, and the \emph{degree} is how many consequtive blocks it
will fetch starting at this location in memory.

\subsection{Delta Correlating Prefetching Table Algorithm}

The DCPT prefetcher uses a more advanced algorithm. It is an instruction-based
prefetcher using a table indexed by the address of the instruction which tried
to access memory. Each entry contains a ring buffer of the most recent deltas
between successive addresses accessed by this instruction. When an access
happens, the prefetcher examines the two most recent deltas and searches the
ring buffer for patterns beginning with these two deltas. If there are multiple
matches, we choose the longest matching sequence of deltas.

The prefetcher then adds the found delta pattern to the current address to
obtain the predicted stream of future accesses. It discards addresses which
are already in the cache, or ones that are already being prefetched. It then
issues prefetch commands for the remaining addresses.
