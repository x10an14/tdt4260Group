Short version:

1. If you don't have SCons version 0.96.91 or newer, get it from
http://wwww.scons.org.

2. If you don't have SWIG version 1.3.28 or newer, get it from
http://wwww.swig.org.

3. In this directory, type 'scons build/ALPHA_SE/tests/debug/quick'.  This
will build the debug version of the m5 binary (m5.debug) for the Alpha
syscall emulation target, and run the quick regression tests on it.

WHAT'S INCLUDED (AND NOT)
-------------------------

The basic source release includes these subdirectories:
 - m5: 
   - src: source code of the m5 simulator
   - tests: regression tests
   - ext: less-common external packages needed to build m5

To run full-system simulations, you will need compiled console,
PALcode, and kernel binaries and one or more disk images.  These files
are collected in a separate archive, m5_system.tar.bz2.  This file
can he downloaded separately.

M5 supports Linux 2.4/2.6, FreeBSD, and the proprietary Compaq/HP
Tru64 version of Unix. We are able to distribute Linux and FreeBSD
bootdisks, but we are unable to distribute bootable disk images of
Tru64 Unix. If you have a Tru64 license and are interested in
obtaining disk images, contact us at m5-users@m5sim.org
